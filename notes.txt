bug: After clicking 'All Jobs' in navbar, comment form not rendering after click 'Add a comment'.
  - fixed: added 'jquery-turbolinks' gem to fix conflict with `document.ready` and turbo-links.

bug: Search for 'software developer' does not find 'developer' or 'rails developer' as a result. This is an issue
     with passing in multiple strings to the search query.

improvement: Utilize Bootstrap grid system and improve responsiveness.
